### Exercise 1-1: Taking Stock
-  What are your web design goals? To become a professional web designer? To make personal websites only?
> I want to be a good enough coder to create the dream website of my clients.
- Which aspects of web design interest you the most?
> Backend development is very interesting since not many seem to focus on it. Anything to do with JavaScript is cool, but I wouldn't say no to HTML/CSS.
> Ideally, though, since I _can_ write, I want to be one of those unicorns that can wear most of the webdev hats.
- What current skills do you have?
> I have some coding experience in C, C++, Python, and Java. I need to learn Haskell and maybe Lua on the side. I know how to handle Linux computers and Bash scripting. This will give me a head start on backend stuff and JavaScript.
> I can express myself decently well, and can write. This can help in generating content.
- Which skills will you need to brush up on?
> I have zero sense for design and art, so I certainly need to improve on that if I want to be a full-stack developer. I also have not been practicing my HTML and CSS, so I need to review those too.
- Which hardware and software tools do you already have for web design?
> VIM BABY
- Which tools do you need to buy?
> Nothing really, maybe a Mac
