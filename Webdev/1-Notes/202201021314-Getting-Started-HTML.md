# Getting Started with HTML and CSS
## 1. HTML and CSS
- p. 48 of PDF
- These are the very fundamentals; the basics of why HTML and CSS work and stuff.
	- HTML
		- Is a text file that tells the browser how to assemble a webpage.
		- It is pure text, without any formatting whatsoever.
		- Its extension is .html.
		- Each HTML document creates a single webpage in the browser.
		- index.html is loaded by default when no HTML doc is specified.
			- It's the site's home page.
		- CSS
			- Like HTML, is a plain text file.
			- Specifies the styling of the page -- fonts, colors, column widths, and the like.
			- Its extension is .css.
### Naming Conventions
