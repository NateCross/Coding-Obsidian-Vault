# Chapter 2: How the Web Works 
- Computers known as servers "serve up" documents upon request.
    - Nothing special about these servers hardware-wise; it's in the software.
    - Typically uses Apache (Unix) or Microsoft Internet Information Services
- If a webpage doesn't end with a filename, that's because it's actually accessing index.html or whatever the default name for webpages in a certain directory are.
- Performance tip
    - If you want to minimize round trips to the server, include slashes at the end of dir names in URLs in your link.

# Chapter 3: Some Big Concepts You Need to Know
- A multitude of devices
    - Devices have different screen sizes
        - ![[Pasted image 20220201110048.png]]
    - Also don't make any assumptions on network speed; users may have slow connection
    - Technically no such thing as a "mobile web," it's all just one web
    - _Mobile First_ by Luke Wroblewski
- Sticking with the standards
    - Follow the guidelines set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
        - Primary tool for ensuring consistency and forwards-compatibility
    - _[W3C Standards](https://w3.org/standards)_

        - Kinda dated but still solid
- Progressive Enhancement
    - Strategy for dealing with unknown browser capabilities
        - A flip side to __graceful degradation__, wherein you design the full experience first and create fallbacks in case things aren't supported by the browser.
    - Start with a baseline experience that makes content available to all browsers and assistive devices.
    - Layer on advanced features for browsers that can handle them.
    - Least priority would be animations
    - Informs all aspects of page design and production
        - Authoring strategy
            - The HTML document must be written in logical order and its elements marked up in a meaningful way
            - Keep accessibility in mind
        - Styling strategy
            - Create layers of experience by taking advantage of style sheet rules
            - Start with basic things, like a red background, then add a gradient with a check if the browser supports gradients.
                - Can also use a cutting edge CSS selector to deliver certain styles only to cutting edge browsers.
        - Scripting strategy
            - Ensure basic functionality works, like linking from page to page and accomplishing essential tasks even if JavaScript is off.

- Responsive Web Design
    - Provide appropriate layouts depending on the size of the viewport (browser window).
    - Serve a single HTML document to all devices, but apply different style sheets based on the screen size
        - For mobile, make things appear in one column with large links for easy tapping.
        - For desktop, multiple columns with traditional navigation elements.
        - This is possible with CSS.

    - It may be preferable to build a separate mobile site with a customized interface and feature set
        - M-dot sites
            - URLs begin with "m." or "mobile"
            - Good if mobile and desktop users have different usage patterns
            - Response Web Design is not a universal solution. It works best for text content. For complex sites, a different experience is preferred.
- Accessibility
    - Vision impairment
        - Screen reader
        - Braille
        - Screen magnifier
    - Mobility impairment
        - Modified mice and keyboards
        - Foot pedals
        - Voice commands
    - Auditory impairment
        - Transcripts for audio and video
    - Cognitive impairment
        - Design sites clearly to help with memory and reading comprehension
    - The W3C started the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://w3.org/WAI). Good starting point to learn about web accessibility.
- Site Performance
    - Still critical even though less people use dial-up and stuff
    - How
        - Limit filesizes
        - Reduce requests to a server
    - Other examples
        - Optimize images to have the smallest file size possible without sacrificing quality
        - Streamline HTML, avoid unnecessary levels of nested elements
        - Minimize HTML and CSS documents by removing extra spaces and returns
        - Keep JS to a minimum
        - Add scripts in such a way that they load in parallel with other page assets and don't block rendering
        - Don't load unnecessary assets
        - Reduce the number of times the browse
