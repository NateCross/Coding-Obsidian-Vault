# Chapter 3: Functions
## Defining a Function
```js
const square = function(x) {
    return x * x;
};

console.log(square(12));
// -> 144
```
```js
const makeNoise = function() {
    console.log("Pling!");
};

makeNoise();
// → Pling!

const power = function(base, exponent) {
    let result = 1;
    for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
        result *= base;
    }
    return result;
};

console.log(power(2, 10));
// → 1024

```
## Bindings and Scopes
- If a binding/variable is defined outside of a function or block, it is globally scoped and can be referred to by the whole program.
- Local bindings are bindings defined only in a function or block.
    - Every time the function is called, new instances are created of these bindings.
- Bindings declared with `let` and `const` are local to the block that they are declared in.
    - If created inside a loop, the code before and after the loop cannot "see" it.
    - 
## Pointers
- A return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return `undefined`
    - Also occurs if you don't return anything
