# Chapter 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays
## Data Sets
__Declaring and using an array__
```js
let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
console.log(listOfNumbers[2]);
// → 5
console.log(listOfNumbers[0]);
// → 2
console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]);
// → 3
```
- Pretty straightforward stuff.
## Properties
- `null` and `undefined` do not have properties.
- Access properties with the `.` operator.
    - For example, `Math.max` or `myString.length`.
    - These properties can be functions as well—methods.
## Methods
```js
let sequence = [1, 2, 3];
sequence.push(4);
sequence.push(5);
console.log(sequence);
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(sequence.pop());
// → 5
console.log(sequence);
// → [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
- More straightforward stuff.

## Objects
- Values of type `object` are arbitrary collection of properties.
- To create, use braces as an expression.
```js
let day1 = {
  squirrel: false,
  events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"]
};
console.log(day1.squirrel);
// → false
console.log(day1.wolf);
// → undefined
day1.wolf = false;
console.log(day1.wolf);
// → false
```
- Each property is separated by commas
    - First, there's the name, and the value separated by a colon.
    - Invalid binding names have to be quoted.
```js
let descriptions = {
  work: "Went to work",
  "touched tree": "Touched a tree"
};
```
