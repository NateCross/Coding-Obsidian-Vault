# Eloquent JavaScript
## Chapter 2: Program Structure
- To catch and hold values,  JS provides a ==binding== or a ==variable==.
```javascript
let caught = 5 * 5;
```
- The equals operator can be used at any time on existing bindings to disconnect them from their current value and have them point to a new one.
- Keywords for bindings include `var`, `let`, and `const`

**Program showing control flow**
```javascript
let theNum = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));
if (!Number.isNaN(theNum)) {
  console.log(`Your number is the square root of ${theNum * theNum}`);
}
```
- __Loops function pretty much the same as in C__
- But not exactly for loops

For Loop, the usual way
```js
for (let number = 0; number <= 12; number = number + 2) {
    console.log(number);
}
// -> 0
// -> 2
// ... etcetera
```
There exists a way to loop for arrays and stuff, but we'll get to that later

- __Switch statements work exactly the same as in C__
```js
switch (prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
    case "rainy":
        console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
        break;
    case "sunny":
        console.log("Dress lightly.");
        break;
    case "cloudy":
        console.log("Go outside.");
        break;
        
}
```
