# Eloquent JavaScript
## Chapter 2: Program Structure
- To catch and hold values,  JS provides a ==binding== or a ==variable==.
```javascript
let caught = 5 * 5;
```
- The equals operator can be used at any time on existing bindings to disconnect them from their current value and have them point to a new one.
- Keywords for bindings include `var`, `let`, and `const`
