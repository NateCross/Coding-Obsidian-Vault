# Eloquent JavaScript
## Chapter 2: Program Structure
- To catch and hold values,  JS provides a ==binding== or a ==variable==.
```javascript
let caught = 5 * 5;
```
- The equals operator can be used at any time on existing bindings to disconnect them from their current value and have them point to a new one.
- Keywords for bindings include `var`, `let`, and `const`

**Program showing control flow**
```javascript
let theNum = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));
if (!Number.isNaN(theNum)) {
  console.log(`Your number is the square root of ${theNum * theNum}`);
}
```
- __Loops function pretty much the same as in C__
