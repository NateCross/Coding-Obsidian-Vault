- These are the very fundamentals; the basics of why HTML and CSS work and stuff.
	- HTML
	- Is a text file that tells the browser how to assemble a webpage.
	- It is pure text, without any formatting whatsoever.
	- Each HTML document creates a single webpage in the browser.
	- index.html is loaded by default when no HTML doc is specified.
		- It's the site's home page.
